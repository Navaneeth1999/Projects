NPK Sensor with Arduino and Display System
The NPK Sensor with Arduino and Display System is a real-time soil monitoring solution designed to measure essential soil nutrients—Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)—that are vital for plant growth. The sensor is integrated with an Arduino microcontroller, which processes the data and displays the readings on an LCD or OLED screen for easy visualization.

This system allows farmers, gardeners, and researchers to monitor soil health efficiently, ensuring optimal nutrient levels for crops and improving agricultural productivity. By using the NPK sensor, they can make informed decisions about fertilization and soil management, potentially reducing waste and increasing yields.

Key Features:
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously displays current levels of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium in the soil.
User-friendly Interface: The LCD/OLED display shows nutrient data in an easy-to-read format.
Customizable Threshold Alerts: The system can be programmed to trigger alarms or notifications when nutrient levels fall below or exceed ideal thresholds.
Portable and Energy Efficient: The compact Arduino-based design ensures low power consumption, making it ideal for field use.
Modular Design: The system can be expanded with additional sensors (like pH, moisture, or temperature sensors) for comprehensive soil analysis.
